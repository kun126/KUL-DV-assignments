# KUL-DV-assignments

Here are two assignments of G0R72A Data Visualization in Data Science.

### Assignment 1
15 creative designs of a given dataset about energy consumption.

### Assignment 2
Ideas of combined designs with other group members.

### D3.js exercises and the final project
Luckily, one of my designs from assignment 2 was chosen as **design 3 of our final project.** 

Here you can find it with my implementations: https://r0909416-datavis-exercises.vercel.app/final_project (r0909416 was my student number at KUL).
